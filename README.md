# Edge-AI-for-Smart-Agriculture-Tomato-Detection-and-Grading-with-YOLOv10-CBAM

## Overview
This project focuses on applying AI to smart agriculture for automatic tomato detection and maturity classification. It combines computer vision, deep learning, and edge AI deployment to enable real-time perception for agricultural robotics and automated harvesting systems. The work was carried out in R&D context and resulted in a Scopus-indexed publication and an 80-page master’s thesis.

## Objectives
- Review the state of the art of AI applications in agriculture
- Compare and benchmark YOLO-based object detection algorithms (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv10)
- Develop a robust tomato detection and grading algorithm
- Optimize deep learning models for resource-constrained edge devices
- Deploy and validate the system in real-world conditions
